			<p>The Countries in the USSR block were Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania and, the block led by the USA included Norway, the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece, also in line with Austria, Ireland and Sweden. Finland and Switzerland remained neutral.</p>
			<p>The Cold War implied not only an increase in an arm race between the contending parties, political and social unrest, but also had a strong impact in other aspects of society like the space race and performance in sports and competition. Particularly in sports, the world witnessed how scenarios for healthy competition and rivalry became a weapon for international political affairs.</p>

			<p>During the Winter Olympics of 1948 and 1952, the Eastern block had a modest participation. This was a time of economic recovery and austerity for European countries that were vastly destroyed by confrontations during the Second World War. This explains why countries like the United States, Canada, Norway and Sweden obtained a higher number of Olympic victories and medals. Their infrastructure and economy during the war was not widely affected, so economic and social recovery was faster and stronger.</p>

			<p>After the Warsaw Pact, the Eastern Block consolidated which caused that Olympic sports in the USSR gained a stellar role in the world. It served not only to showcase their strength as a great nation, but also as a propaganda machine to spread their politics and communist ideas using the games as a platform.</p>
